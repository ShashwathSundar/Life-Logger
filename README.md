# Life-Logger<p>

This is a web app written for <b>google apps script</b>.<p>
It effectively is a webpage with alot of buttons (one button for each life activity).<p>
</t>When a button is clicked its <b>value</b> (life activity) is update in the google sheet with its timestamp.<p>
</t>There is also a text field for custom entry, incase you want to update an activity that does not have a button for it yet.<p>
<hr>
The list of buttons can be changed in a separate button list sheet.</p>
This is possible because the buttons are being dynamically created using JS.<br>
So there is no need to mess around with the code for adding or removing new buttons.</p>
<hr>
The webpage UI is responsive and uses Bootstrap (cuz Im lazy).</p>
I wanted the code to be compact so the CSS and JS stuff is all in the index.html file itself.
